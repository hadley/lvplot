Letter value plots are an alternative to boxplots which extend the number of "letter value" statistics used. For large datasets, this gives you more information about the tail behaviour and displays fewer "outliers".

## Installation

You can install lvplot from CRAN with `install.packages("lvplot")` or from GitHub with `devtools::install_github("hadley/lvplot")`.
