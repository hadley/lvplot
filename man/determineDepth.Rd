\title{Determine depth of letter values needed for n observations.}
\usage{
determineDepth(n, k = NULL, alpha = NULL, perc = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of observation to be shown in the LV boxplot}

\item{k}{number of letter value statistics used}

\item{alpha}{if supplied, depth k is calculated such that (1-\code{alpha})100% confidence
intervals of an LV statistic do not extend into
neighboring LV statistics.}

\item{perc}{if supplied, depth k is adjusted such that \code{perc} percent
outliers are shown}
}
\description{
Determine depth of letter values needed for n observations.
}
\details{
Supply one of \code{k}, \code{alpha} or \code{perc}.
